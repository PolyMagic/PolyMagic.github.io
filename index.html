            <h4 class="subtitle">Beginnings</h4>
            <p>
              I started programming around 2014, I was having some fun with c++
              programming at the time, but I never managed to complete any fully
              fledged project.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2016, I found out about JS, I got fluent with it in no time
              because of its simplistic structure. I started learning about
              awesome frameworks that are available for this lang, and my
              favourite one turned out to be VueJs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later I got into server side programming with NodeJs, At the time I
              was creating a lot of web scrapers that involved login into accounts
              remotely and adding, editing, deleting information from them.
              Because of that I learned a lot about different HTTP request, login
              security, managing sessions, etc. Despite the fact that I never
              wrote backend server myself, I knew how they work and how they are
              secured. I really enjoyed a feeling of accomplishment that I got
              every time I finally bypassed server security after long hours of
              trying.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later using data and knowledge that I got from writing scrapers, I
              started to write RestAPIs for my Vue frontend apps.
            </p>

            <h4 class="subtitle">Present Times</h4>
            <p>
              Today after this long journey I'm now back again to c++, I'm not
              master in it by any means, but I understand it now a lot better than
              5 years ago, I mainly use it for OpenGL rendering, a field where JS
              in my opinion can't compet with low level language like c++. Js is
              still a lang that I'm most fluent in, but I like to try different
              things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Languages that I mainly use now are: Js, C++, Kotlin and from time
              to time GoLag

              <p>
                Neothesia is my latest project, and my first ever attempt at
                maintaining a fork. Working with codebase that was not written
                completely by me is quite new experience for me. Goal of this
                project is to bring back Legacy Synthesia that was abandoned in
                favour of closed source commercial project to live, and make it
                look and work as good (or even better) than commercial
                Synthesia. Neothesia is midi visualizer, which means that it
                takes music notes from midi file and displays them as colourful
                falling blocks on virtual piano.

                Anime-Cli is my attempt at creating anime downloading CLI, I

                maintain anime hostings that are constantly changing their
                methods of preventing scraping. Besides that I'm not satisfied
                with how codebase looks at the moment, it would require major
                rewrite to make me feel confident with it

                lessons are cancelled, and of course most important... how many
                minutes and seconds are left to end of certain lesson

                downloading information from MyAnimeList, for simple requests
                like getting lists, descriptions,etc. it uses JikanAPI. I
                created it because in every MAL related project I always rewrote
                same API requests, and now they are in small convenient package.
                I also added some of my own scrapers into this package that
                enables you to remotely login into MAL, update your list and get
                notifications.

              <p>
                Piano is my main instrument, and when taking time spend playing to skill ratio, I am really bad at it, I'm not sure what is the reason of this, maybe I'm completely ungifted or maybe it's because I'm completely self thought and no one pointed out my mistakes.
                To be honest I actually don't care, I really enjoy playing piano so something like this will not dis encourage me.
